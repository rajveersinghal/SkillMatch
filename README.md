## 🏗️ System Architecture

SkillMatch follows a decoupled, modern architecture designed for speed and scalability.

## 🌊 Core Flow & NLP Pipeline

The "Neural Pulse" of SkillMatch lies in its multi-stage NLP pipeline:

1.  **Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Raw text is extracted from PDFs/DOCX and normalized (case folding, stop-word removal, lemmatization).
2.  **Entity Recognition**: The `Skill Extractor` uses high-precision Regex patterns with word-boundary awareness to identify technical and soft skills.
3.  **Vectorization**: Documents are transformed into Sparse Vectors (TF-IDF) to capture the relative importance of terms.
4.  **Similarity Scoring**: `Cosine Similarity` is calculated between the Resume and JD vectors to produce a match percentage.
5.  **Gap Analysis**: Missing skills are identified by comparing extracted sets and categorized via a curated **Skill Taxonomy**.
6.  **Intelligent Suggestions**:
    *   **Co-occurrence**: Suggests tools often used together (e.g., Python → Pandas).
    *   **Semantic Proximity**: Uses `Sentence-Transformers` (MiniLM) to find related skills in high-dimensional vector space.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisite Setup
*   Clone the repository.
*   Ensure **MongoDB** is running (local or Atlas).
*   Configure the `.env` file:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
    SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
    ALGORITHM=HS256
    ```

### 2. Backend Execution
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Server
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
*API Docs available at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`*

### 3. Frontend Execution
```bash
cd frontend-react
npm install
npm run dev
```
*App available at: `http://localhost:5173`*

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues (SSL/Whitelist)
If you encounter `SSL handshake failed` or `Timeout` errors:
1.  **IP Whitelisting**: Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) -> **Network Access** -> **Add IP Address** -> **Add Current IP Address**.
2.  **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure `certifi` is installed.
3.  **Connection String**: Verify your `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file is correct and includes the password.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **LLM Integration**: Deep qualitative analysis using OpenAI/Anthropic.
- [ ] **Automated PDF Reports**: Export branded match reports for candidates.
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Shared folders for recruitment teams.
